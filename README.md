A simple, beginner-friendly website that allows users to take a narcissism personality test.

## How It Works

## Files Explained

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that structures the webpage

## How to Use

2. That's it! No installation needed.

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

1. The quiz has 15 questions about personality traits
2. Each question has 5 answer options (Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)
3. Each answer has a value (0 to 4)
4. At the end, all values are added up to get a total score
5. The score determines the result category (Low, Moderate, High, etc.)

## Customization
